## Project Summary

Our team selects US Pollution Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/uspollution). This dataset contains detailed, everyday data of four major pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone) of US Pollution from 2000 to 2016 documented by US EPA. We believe that by using this large dataset as a fundamental database, we can implement a "US Pollution Atlas" providing easy-to-use frontend toggles, search bars for finding specific data, visualizations of pollution trends, and predictions of future pollution data.

The US Pollution Atlas will provide the user with an interactive graphical interface for navigating the large and complex US Pollution Dataset as a baseline, including functionality for users to read, obtain, update, insert, and delete specific pollution data. The user will be able to toggle many different parameters and search by location and time in order to derive insights into pollution data within the US at many levels of detail. For example, we will provide functionality for visualizing national, state, and local (specifically county) level pollution data for different types of pollutants such as CO2, O3, and NO2.
